# Customer_segmentation

## Overview
The data and design for this project were provided by Arvato Financial Services. I applied unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. I processed the data, applied dimensionality reduction techniques, and implemented clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company.
These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

## Programming language
Python
Libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn

## Short summary
Target customer segments share caracterstics such as age over 46 years and a high interest in money. Moreover, they have higher income and tend to stay at the same place.
